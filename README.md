### [From Basic to Beautiful: How I Built My GitHub Profile That Actually Stands Out](https://github.com/devsergiocardona/devsergiocardona)

As a recent Computer Science graduate from UCF now working as a Software Engineer at SportsEngine, I wanted my GitHub profile to reflect who I am as a developer—not just show a bunch of green squares. Here's how I transformed my basic GitHub profile into something that actually represents my personality and skills.

**Key highlights:**
- Created a special repository to unlock profile customization
- Added dynamic typing animation and custom banner
- Integrated professional tech stack display with visual icons
- Set up automated GitHub Actions for fresh content
- Learned that less is more when it comes to professional polish

*The goal isn't to have the flashiest profile on GitHub—it's to have one that authentically represents you as a developer while showcasing your technical skills in a visually appealing way.*

### [AI-Powered Development: How Machine Learning is Changing Frontend Development](https://github.com/devsergiocardona/devsergiocardona)

As a frontend developer working with Angular and JavaScript, I've been fascinated by how AI is revolutionizing the way we build user interfaces. From intelligent code completion to automated testing, machine learning is becoming an essential tool in modern web development.

**What's changing:**
- GitHub Copilot and AI pair programming transforming how we write code
- Automated accessibility testing powered by computer vision
- Smart design-to-code tools reducing development time
- AI-driven performance optimization and bundle analysis
- Machine learning models running directly in the browser with TensorFlow.js

*The future of frontend development isn't about AI replacing developers—it's about developers who understand AI replacing those who don't. The tools are evolving fast, and staying curious about these changes is what separates good developers from great ones.*
